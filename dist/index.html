    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>

    <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>

    <p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>

    <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.</p>

    <p>CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.

A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.</p>

  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Selector">
    <header>Selector</header>
    <p>In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.</p>
    <p>Selectors may apply to the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
      <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>id: an identifier unique within the document</li>
        <li>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document</li>
      </ul>  
        
      <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
    </ul>
            

<p>Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.</p>

<p>Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is <code>:hover</code>, which identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in <code>a:hover</code> or <code>#elementid:hover</code>. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as <code>:link</code> or <code>:visited</code>, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as <code>::first-line</code> or <code>::first-letter</code>.</p>

<p>Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility. Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, <code>div .myClass {color: red;}</code> applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas <code>.myClass div {color: red;}</code> applies to all div elements that are in elements of class myClass.</p>

    
    
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Declaration_Block">
    <header>Declaration Block</header>
    <p>A declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each declaration itself consists of a property, a colon (:), and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon (;) must be inserted to separate each declaration.</p>

<p>Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a set of possible values. Some properties can affect any type of element, and others apply only to particular groups of elements.</p>

<p>Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit", or numerical values, such as 200px (200 pixels), 50vw (50 percent of the viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent element's width). Color values can be specified with keywords (e.g. "red"), hexadecimal values (e.g. #FF0000, also abbreviated as #F00), RGB values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. rgb(255, 0, 0)), RGBA values that specify both color and alpha transparency (e.g. rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)), or HSL or HSLA values (e.g. hsl(000, 100%, 50%), hsla (000, 100%, 50%, 80%)).</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Use">
    <header>Use</header>
    <p>Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.</p>

<p>For example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for these elements is presentational.</p>

<p>Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Sources">
    <header>Sources</header>
    <p>CSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the user and the author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline, media type, importance, selector specificity, rule order, inheritance and property definition. CSS style information can be in a separate document or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple style sheets can be imported. Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being used; for example, the screen version can be quite different from the printed version, so that authors can tailor the presentation appropriately for each medium.</p>

<p>The style sheet with the highest priority controls the content display. Declarations not set in the highest priority source are passed on to a source of lower priority, such as the user agent style. The process is called cascading.</p>

<p>One of the goals of CSS is to allow users greater control over presentation. Someone who finds red italic headings difficult to read may apply a different style sheet. Depending on the browser and the web site, a user may choose from various style sheets provided by the designers, or may remove all added styles and view the site using the browser's default styling, or may override just the red italic heading style without altering other attributes.</p>  
  </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="Specificity">
    <header>Specificity</header>
    <p>Specificity refers to the relative weights of various rules.[15] It determines which styles apply to an element when more than one rule could apply. Based on specification, a simple selector (e.g. H1) has a specificity of 1, class selectors have a specificity of 1,0, and ID selectors a specificity of 1,0,0. Because the specificity values do not carry over as in the decimal system, commas are used to separate the "digits" (a CSS rule having 11 elements and 11 classes would have a specificity of 11,11, not 121).</p>  
    
  </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="Inheritance">
    <header>Inheritance</header>
    <p>Inheritance is a key feature in CSS; it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants. Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of XHTML elements in a page based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them. In general, descendant elements inherit text-related properties, but their box-related properties are not inherited. Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display, float and clear, height, and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index.</p>

<p>Inheritance can be used to avoid declaring certain properties over and over again in a style sheet, allowing for shorter CSS.</p>

<p>Inheritance in CSS is not the same as inheritance in class-based programming languages, where it is possible to define class B as "like class A, but with modifications". With CSS, it is possible to style an element with "class A, but with modifications". However, it is not possible to define a CSS class B like that, which could then be used to style multiple elements without having to repeat the modifications.</p>  
  </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="Whitespace">
    <header>Whitespace</header>
    <p class="special">Whitespace between properties and selectors is ignored. This code snippet:

<code> body{overflow:hidden;background:#000000;background-image:url(images/bg.gif);background-repeat:no-repeat;background-position:left top;}</code>
is functionally equivalent to this one:

<br><code>body {
        overflow: hidden;
        background-color: #000000;
        background-image: url(images/bg.gif);
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: left top;
      }</code>

<p>One common way to format CSS for readability is to indent each property and give it its own line. In addition to formatting CSS for readability, shorthand properties can be used to write out the code faster, which also gets processed more quickly when being rendered:</p>

<code>body {
   overflow: hidden;
  background: #000 url(images/bg.gif) no-repeat left top;}</code>
</p>  
  </section>
  
  <section class="main-section" id="Positioning">
    <header>Positioning</header>
    <p>CSS 2.1 defines three positioning schemes:</p>

<h4>Normal flow</h4>
<p>Inline items are laid out in the same way as the letters in words in text, one after the other across the available space until there is no more room, then starting a new line below. Block items stack vertically, like paragraphs and like the items in a bulleted list. Normal flow also includes relative positioning of block or inline items, and run-in boxes.</p>
<h4>Floats</h4>
<p>A floated item is taken out of the normal flow and shifted to the left or right as far as possible in the space available. Other content then flows alongside the floated item.</p>
<h4>Absolute positioning</h4>
<p>An absolutely positioned item has no place in, and no effect on, the normal flow of other items. It occupies its assigned position in its container independently of other items.</p>
<h3>Position property</h3>
<p>There are four possible values of the position property. If an item is positioned in any way other than static, then the further properties top, bottom, left, and right are used to specify offsets and positions.</p>

<h4>Static</h4>
<p>The default value places the item in the normal flow</p>
<h4>Relative</h4>
<p>The item is placed in the normal flow, and then shifted or offset from that position. Subsequent flow items are laid out as if the item had not been moved.</p>
<h4>Absolute</h4>
<p>Specifies absolute positioning. The element is positioned in relation to its nearest non-static ancestor.</p>
<h4>Fixed</h4>
<p>The item is absolutely positioned in a fixed position on the screen even as the rest of the document is scrolled<p/>
<h3>Float and clear</h3>
<p>The float property may have one of three values. Absolutely positioned or fixed items cannot be floated. Other elements normally flow around floated items, unless they are prevented from doing so by their clear property.<p/>

<h4>left</h4>
<p>The item floats to the left of the line that it would have appeared in; other items may flow around its right side.</p>
<p>right</h4>
The item floats to the right of the line that it would have appeared in; other items may flow around its left side.</p>
<p>clear</h4>
Forces the element to appear underneath ('clear') floated elements to the left (clear:left), right (clear:right) or both sides (clear:both).</p>
